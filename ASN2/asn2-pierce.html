      <h2>
        Industry Leader Credits Hard Work, Determination, Licensing Fees as Keys
        to its Success
      </h2>

      <p>
        In its best performance since the company was founded in 1993, WidgetCo
        Inc. announced that its third-quarter profits for 2014 totalled $217
        million. "This only points to the continuing strength of WidgetCo and
        its wonderful, hardworking employees," said John X. Corphead, CEO and
        Chairman of the Board. "With a workforce this dedicated, I have every
        confidence that our fourth-quarter earnings will be equally impressive.
        I continue to be as proud as a new father of our company and its
        incredible products."

      <p>
        A pioneer in the fast-growing field of widget mass production and
        distribution, WidgetCo has introduced several new products over the last
        twelve months, including the industrial-strength Fusion Widget, the
        highly popular Farming Widget, and media darling Plaid Widget. WidgetCo
        also holds the patents on several key widget technologies, including the
        industry-standard Parallel Widget Extruder C2100, and its reasonable
        licensing fees to other players in the widget-production industry has
        enabled it to remain a leader in this field. A corporate restructuring
        and workforce-reduction initiative early in 2014 has helped boost
        profits to their current record levels, according to Corphead. "By
        streamlining our workflow, we've made ourselves more flexible and
        adaptable, which is a necessity as we bring this company into the 21st
        century," Corphead says.
